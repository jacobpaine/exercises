Backticks on either side can call out commands.
Like `git status` for example.

Three backticks before and after calls out a block of code.

```
function bPaisley(song){
  if(seeYouOutInTheMoonlight){
    if(kissingWayBackInTheSticks){
      if(walkThruFieldOfWildflowers){
        checkYouForTicks();
      }
    }
  }
}
```
