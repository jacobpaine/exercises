Run the sandwich.html code in a browser. Make sure to remember to place sandwich.html in the same directory as meat.js, bread.js, and sandwich-maker.js.

This code is intended to help build a sandwich and record the total cost. It currently only uses
the bread and the meat (although there are other boxes in the HTML) and display prices in the console log.
Every selection of 'Make me a sandwich' (currently only bread and meat) will increment the total in the log.
